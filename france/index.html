<h3> Steve and Angela's trip to France </h3>
<hr>

Angela and I went to France for a friend's wedding in December of
1998.  We stayed there for about a week and visited Paris for the
first few days.  Here are some pictures we took, with some comments.

Here is Angela on one of the many bridges spanning the Seine.  Since
we were jetlagged we were up at some awful hour in the morning, but at
least it was very beautiful.

On our morning stroll through Paris, we stopped for a picture in front
of this impressive-looking building.  Unfortunately, I forget what it
was (drop me a <a href="mailto:kehlet@techfuel.com">line</a> if you
know).

This is the Pont Neuf, or New Bridge.  It is very famous.

streets nearby.

This picture intrigued me because I thought the buildings were very
pretty lined up against the Seine.

Wellll.... this is the closet that was our bathroom.  I realize having
a closet, I mean bathroom of our own could be considered be some to be
a luxury, but this is ridiculous!

Now this is classy!  After our first hotel turned out to be a dump, we
decided to find somewhere nicer.  And that we did: the St. Lazare.

There were even <i>robes</i> for us in the bathroom.  I could probably
fit my huge, American-sized closet at home inside this bathroom
(instead of the other way around).

The view outside our window at the St. Lazare onto the streets below
was pretty cool.  This is facing to the left.

This is facing straight out.  We ended up getting something to eat at
that Kanterbrau cafe you can see.

This is me, and we're on the Champs Elysee at night.  The whole street
was decorated and all the trees had lights in them.  There were lots
of people walking around everywhere.

</td>

Of course, the obligatory picture of the Eiffle Tower.  I was
completely surprised on how big it was!  The message lit up is a
countdown in days to the year 2000.  By the time we finally got up to
the second stage (just above the lighted numbers) it was dark, and
very cold.  There were millions of tourists from all over the world
waiting in line.

Here is Angela, and we are at the Louvre.  Note the line of people in
the background waiting to get in.  The glass pyramid was apparantly
designed by an American, and is the subject of some ridicule by the
French. But I have to ask, who is the greater fool: the fool that
designed it, or the fool that actually agreed to put it there?

This is one wing of the Louvre.  But I actually took the picture to
show how ridiculously long the line was to get in.  You can see people
in the foreground lined up, but also notice how the line enters the
archway on the right, then wraps back to the left inside the building
and well off the left of the picture!  The crazy thing was this was
about 3pm, and the museum closes around 5pm or so.  Those people will
never get in!

Here is another picture of the Louvre.  It's big.  The funny thing is
I kept trying to get away from the lady in the orange shirt so she
wouldn't be in the picture.  Turns out, she was waiting for me to
hurry up and finish so she could ask me to take a picture of her and
her husband.

This is a mini-Arch De Triomphe right by the Louvre.  Since we won't
be seeing the Louvre on this trip, we decided to take a stroll on the
greenway that leads from the Louvre to the real Arch De Triomphe.

So as we're walking away, here's one final look back at the Louvre
through the mini-Arch De Triomphe.

This was at our third hotel in Paris, The Concord.  I felt like
Crocodile Dundee, seeing one of these for the first time.

everywhere.

I hate to admit it, but after a couple of days in France I was dying
for some American food (and American-sized beverage).  Now, I hardly
ever eat McDonald's in America, but finding it then and there was a
godsend.

I had to take this picture to point out that indeed, in Europe they
call the Quarter Pounder the "Royale with Cheese", as stated in Pulp
Fiction (since they don't use pounds, they use kilograms). Too bad you
can't really see it in the scan (seven items down on the left, you
can almost make out "Royal"), but it's there.

<br>
<br>

Another funny thing was they called the Supersize option <i>Maxi
Best-Of</i>.  That's hilarious!  What kind of pseudo-English phrase is
that?  I didn't know what to say, "Je voudrais un Big Mac, <i>Maxi
Best-Of</i>??".  They must think the same thing when they hear
pseudo-French phrases like "Le Car", and such.

I took this picture to demonstrate the difference in size perceptions
of "a cup of coffee".  The small object to the left is a
standard-sized pen, placed there to provide scale.  Seriously, I left
France dehydrated because everything to drink was very small and very
expensive (forget free refills, too).

We are leaving France and at the Charles DeGaulle airport.  This
picture doesn't do it justice, but if you look hard enough you can see
the millions of people being herded through those metal detectors.
Everyone was rude and very pushy--mind you, most of them did not
appear to be French, but maybe other tourists.  I felt like an
animal--it was awful.

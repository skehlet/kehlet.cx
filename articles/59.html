Massive Cox Outage

<img src="/images/2003/08/cable_modem_blinking.gif" alt="my cable modem at the moment"
align="left">

So I sit here in day 2 of Cox's Internet service outage.  My cable modem is sitting there
in my computer closet with its "Status" light blinking indefinitely.  The word I've
received from Cox tech support is that this is all due to the Blaster virus, which has
evidently taken down their entire infrastructure.  However the obvious question is, why is
a Windows virus taking down their networking gear?  I could understand their email and web
servers being down, both of which I could hardly care less about, but why can't my cable
modem sync up?  

<br><br>

Hmm.  Perhaps there's a new RPC DCOM virus out there that Cox caught that's using
vulnerable Windows boxes to DOS vulnerable Cisco equipment (re: the recent IOS
vulnerability from July) within Cox.  Now that would actually be funny.  Oh well gee,
there's no way I'd know about it since I have no Internet.

<br><br>

Argh.  I suspect they just pulled the plug on all home accounts until they finish patching
their systems.

<hr>

<img src="/images/2003/08/resistor.jpg" alt="dang resistor" align="left">

<b>Update 8/17, 11pm:</b> Relief at last!  It turns out the problem most likely had
nothing to do with the customer outages resulting from the Blaster virus, as I was told by
tech support (probably the schmuck just wanted to get me off the phone).  

<br><br>

I happened to remember that on one of the previous, multi-day outages such as this--in
hindsight, there have been several in the 5+ years I've had Cox cable internet
service--that the Cox cable guy came out and tested the line, and determined that the
signal strength was either too high, or too low, and either added or removed a resistor to
the cable line.  Or some such fiddling.  The whole process seemed very unscientific.  He
mentioned "if this ever happens again, you might try fiddling with this resistor".  So I
thought I'd give it a try.  I removed the resistor, plugged the cable back in, waited a
few minutes, and voila!  That status light stopped blinking!  A few tests revealed I had
Internet connectivity again.

<br><br>

Now, from what I've gathered it sounds like this resistor adjusts the signal strength to
bring it in between some acceptible values.  And it sounds like the strength of the signal
you receive depends highly on the number of other people in your neighborhood also using
cable service.  So I have to ask: <i>how can you claim to have a reliable service if in
the very act of plugging in a new customer, you risk knocking off one or more of your
existing customers??</i>  And you, the technician, would never know nor care, since you're
not at the suckers' houses, you're at the guy's house you're getting hooked up.  It seems
like a very bad system.  So probably what happened to me is some jerk up the street
decided he wanted a cable modem, and because of him I got booted for the entire weekend.

Be sure to contact them, and tell them what the problem was, and what the
technician told you on the phone.  Tell them that lying to customers is
unacceptable behavior, and you want them to do something about it.  :)

I have had the exact same isue with COX.  An 'amplifier' was put on to fix
my poor video signal and then later we discoverd that the very same amp is
responsible form my cable modem dropping signal ocasinaly.  Arrrrgh!

The fix as to compromise and ad a less powerfull amplifier.  I asked the
tech if I could just have two lines from the ground box.  One for TV and
one for Internet.  He just snickerd and noded his head in the negative.

btw, this is my first post.  I like your system.  You should go check out

Here's the tech support request I just submitted, we'll see what those
"cox" have to say in response:

Hi, my cable modem lost its connection over the weekend.  I have a
D-Link DCM100, and the Status light kept blinking even after repeated
power cyclings.  I was told by tech support on Saturday and Sunday
that it must be related to the outages caused by the Blaster virus and
that I should just wait for everything to be fixed.  After 2 days, I
remembered from a previous, multi-day outage such as this that the
problem had something to due with the signal strength on the wire, and
the serviceman who came out either added or removed a resistor to the
line.  I looked and saw a resistor on the line, and after removing it
my cable modem was able to sync up and my Internet service was
restored.

I understand that the signal strength is highly dependent on the
number of customers in the area.  But it doesn't seem like a very good
system that by adding or removing service for a customer you risk
disrupting service for one or more existing customers in the area.

The reason I am writing is because I am concerned about the likelihood
of my service being disrupted again in the same manner in the future,
and the difficulty in which this problem can be diagnosed and
corrected (i.e., a serviceman with special equipment must be scheduled
and sent out, I have to take time off work, etc).  I would like to
know if there is more either party can do to prevent this from
happening in the future.

Oh, and by the way, I like this little 45x5 textarea you have for
submitting tech support issues :-).

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and response,

Steve

If my server (behind a COX modem) is not getting a lot of regular trafic
the port seems to go to sleep.  It will come back up on a hit but it takes
a little while.  Once I hit it once it responds pretty quickely for a
while.  Just wondering if you have the same problem and what you do about
it?  Not something I can really ask COX, 'ya know what I mean?

Cox sucks. We have all known this for years. It's a crappy after-thought of
a system, but most of us have no ther options! DSL is great, but only if
you can walk to the central office, and T1s are terrific, if you're made of
money. I can get 'net access from my satellite phone, but only at 14k.

My house isn't even directly connected to a PacBell central office. My
copper goes to a 'fibre hut' where I'm trunked onto a SONET ring to the
C.O. I'm sure you're in the same boat Steve. Why can't they break off a
little bit of that fibre for us?! You know they've got IP running on it, at
least for management. Stick a DSLish card in there, and do some IP
accounting on the peering firewall! It's not that hard guys! (end rant)

As for static IP's, I think the IP only changes when the modem is offline
for 24 hours or if the WAN MAC address changes (like a different
computer).<br />

My Coz internet service was out for about 8 hours on 9-24/25-2009. First
time I called in there was a general message that Internet service was out
&quot;in the entire [Tucson] valley area&quot;, I called in three hours
later and their IVR system said &quot;you called earlier, is this the same
problem&quot; when I said yes it sent me to the queue and obviously they
were overloaded, after 20 mins I hung up.<br />
<br />
Later that day I was in a store and heard a woman saying that she was there
to use the QWest wifi there as &quot;Cox internet is out statewide&quot;.
By that point though my internet was back. I cannot find any news stories
about this outage...<br />

That's too bad. This article was from 2003, a long time ago. My service
with Cox has been excellent in recent years, I have very little to complain
about these days. But I hope their email comes back up for you soon!<br />

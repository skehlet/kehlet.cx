I've been putting off this last phase of the whole project for some time, remembering all
the wonderful things about crawling around in the attic: the heat, the insulation dust
floating around, the bruising on my arms and legs thanks to the hard boards, the redwood
splinters in my hands, the discomfort of breathing through a mask, and the oh-so-pleasant
fogging of my glasses as my own hot breath leaks upwards from the mask.  

<br /><br />

That, and this time the crawl space was much smaller above the master bedroom.  Yes,
<i>cramped and difficult</i> about sums it up.  But I'm thrilled to report the project is
finally complete.  Here are the details.

This is the master bedroom area.  I've already moved the dresser aside.  The goal is to
put an ethernet port next to these existing cable TV and electrical ports.

Toolbox, drill, and a really bright light ready for use.  My goal with the light was to
shine it into the whole in the wall.  When I finished drilling the hole at the top of the
wall in the attic, if I saw light I would know I had a clear path down.

It might have been nice to put the ethernet jack in the same plate as the cable TV, but
there's no way I could fish wires with that outlet box in place.  So I cut a new whole,
right in the middle of the two existing plates.  You can see the faint pencil outline of
the space I cut out just after I took this picture.

I came to affectionately call this particular space as "the channel".  This is where I
spent quite a bit of time crawling up and down.  I did of course move aside all this
insulation first, but we're still talking about a 2-3 foot vertical space (decreasing as
you move down), and about a 20 foot run.  Note the nails protruding from the roof.  And,
mmmm, lots of redwood boards for some lovely splinters.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">
Unfortunately I don't have a whole lot of pictures of what happened in the attic, because
well, it pretty much sucked up there.  But on my first foray down the channel, I followed
the existing cable TV and electrical cables and found where I should drill down.  It was
just at about the limit of where I could reach, and only then with a foot long drill bit
extension.  So I started drilling down through the top board,
whirrrrrrrr..rrrr...rrr...rr...r.... (silence).  Damn, my stupid drill battery died on me.
 Didn't think of that ahead of time.  So... I crawled all the way back out, and down, and
took a break while the batteries recharged. 

<br /><br />

After a short break, I went back up, and crawled down the channel again.  Drilling a 3/4"
hole through that top board proved to be a little tougher than I thought it would be. 
But, I made the hole, and--miraculously--I saw light!  Whoo-hoo! I was a bit surprised
there was no firebreak somewhere down the wall, but hey, I'm not complaining.

At this point, my wife helped me fish the wire up the wall.  I had these wooden sticks I'd
picked up at Lowe's for dirt cheap.  I felt they would be easier to work with than a fish
wire, especially if there had been a firebreak.  As it turned out, yes they were nice and
flexible, and easy to steer, but because of the cramped conditions I had to bend them so
much they broke at least twice, and the duct tape holding them came off at least once.  So
they weren't perfect, but after a couple tries I got the sticks down, Angela taped the
cable to them, and I got the cable pulled all the way up.  Once I had the cable in hand,
the hardest part was over.  Hallelujah.

I ran the cable across the attic to the office, where I already had a hole ready to drop
cable down to the patch panel and switch gear below.  Piece of cake.

</td>

At this point, on the master bedroom side, I attached the cable to an RJ45 jack, and
mounted the wall plate.  Too bad I forgot to take a picture, the job actually looked
semi-professional.  On the other end, in the office (pictured), the goal is to eventually
punch down the cable into my patch panel, and patch it into the switch properly.  For the
moment though, desiring some instant payoff, I simply crimped it and plugged it directly
into the switch.

<b>Summary</b>

<br /><br />

I woke up this morning with one of my fingers throbbing in pain from a nasty splinter that
I missed yesterday, but the effort was definitely worth it.  Wireless is great for
laptops, but having hard-line ethernet in every room is a must for performance and
reliability.  Still to do is get the various Tivo home media options working, like music
and photo viewing from iTunes and iPhoto, and--the feature I'm really most interested
in--multi-room viewing of recorded shows.  But I'll need to replace my Series 1 downstairs
with a Series 2 for that.  Of course, the impulsive guy I am, I ran out and bought another
Series 2 40 hour unit last night (you can get them at the Good Guys for $70 after Tivo's
$100 mail-in rebate, good I think through today 1/31/05), but that'll be another story.

Sweet stuff, Steve!  Man, I wish my whole apt. was wired like that.  When I
finally buy a house, I'm sure all your effort will come in handy to help me
figure out what's in store. ;)<br />
<br />
As for the TiVo thing though...I bought a wireless usb card for it right
after I bought it and it works fine. :)

Thanks!  I will say it's certainly easier now getting around in the attic
than it was at first.  But hopefully I won't need to do it again any time
soon :-).<br />

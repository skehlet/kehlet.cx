Ultima V: Revisiting an Old Favorite

I've been playing Ultima V on my Mac using <a
href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/news.php?show_news=1">Dosbox</a>, an x86 and DOS
emulator (which, although not the point of my article, is pretty cool in itself).  As for
so many others I've talked to, Ultima defined computer gaming for me growing up, starting
with Ultima III and with every installment since.  For a number of reasons, V has always
been my favorite.  It's been a blast playing it again, half my lifetime later, and while
the game is 15 or so years old I find the pieces that made it my favorite then still make
it as fun as ever.

Ultima V was the last in the series to have the two different points-of-view: top-down
while outside, first-person while exploring a dungeon.  How quaint.

This is great fun, Steve.  I was so inspired by this article that I dug up
an Apple ][ emulator for OSX (aptly named OSXII) and then found an old rom
for what I used to tout as the greatest side-scrolling game of all time,
Rescue Raiders.

I figured the nearly 20 years since I had played the game had unfairly
given the game more respect than it was due, so I'd check it out again.

Turns out, it's as much fun now as it was then; though I do miss my
joystick.  Evading enemy smart missiles is a lot more challenging with just
the keyboard.  Frighteningly, all of the keyboard commands came back to me
like I had just played it last week.

As to whether or not it's the best side-scroller ever, I still stand by
that comment, but I can't tell if it's because it really is the greatest
ever, or if it's just the great memories I have of playing it.

Yeah, I can sympathize, it's as though these games have made their way into
our muscles... you are what you play, that's a frightening thought :-).  

I took a look at the OSXII game screen page, wow that brings back some
memories: Karateka, Lode Runner, Archon, Sherwood Forest.  Very cool
stuff.

Great hearing from you again...

Something you might want to check out, there is a (completed!) project to
re-create Ultima V as a DungeonSiege total conversion called the lazarus
project.  Can't give you a full review as I've only just had time to start
it up, but it looks very good so far.

The Lazarus remake is indeed awesome and you can play it on snow leopard
still (with rosetta of course). you can even play an evil ending in that
version. <br />

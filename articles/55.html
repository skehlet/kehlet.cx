I've been playing Morrowind at nights and on weekends for almost two months now, and have
been amazed by the game and its powerful story line.  Since finishing it I've felt the
need to write up a bit of a review for it, and share some of the reasons I found it so
compelling.

<br><br>

For starters, Morrowind is a first-person perspective, single-player RPG that offers an
enormous world to explore, hundreds of quests to fulfill in any way the player chooses,
and is backed by a well-designed mythos with a staggering depth and complexity.  The towns
and people are a mix of numerous distinct races, for example the Nords in the icy regions
of the North, the Imperial citizens on the west coast, the eccentric wizards of the East,
and of course the indigenous Dunmer (dark Elves) who are more than a bit unhappy sharing
their land with the other races ("outlanders").  The landscapes everywhere appear to be
hand-crafted and do not suffer from the "cookie-cutter" appearance other games might use
to quickly fill out a large territory (I read an interview somewhere that claimed they did
lay every tree and rock by hand, which is astonishing given the size of the territory). 
As far as technology, the 3D graphics are first-rate, and the first-person interface is
intuitive and doesn't get in the way.  It is truly refreshing to find an RPG with a
renewed focus on the storyline and the single-player experience, rather than merely
providing hours of multiplayer hack-and-slash with little depth to the story (consider
Neverwinter Nights, Dungeon Siege, and even Diablo II).  Fans of the Ultima series might
appreciate my comment that this is what Ultima 9 should have been, but even better (3
years of technology improvements notwithstanding).

The mythos behind Morrowind is what really intrigued me, it's a complex tapestry woven of
conflict and war between the races, friendship and betrayal, insane gods plotting to take
over the world, false gods struggling to conceal the sins of their past, and ultimately
(with the player's help) a tale of redemption and righting of wrongs.  Entering the game
the player knows nothing of this history or who he or she is--part of the intrigue is to
piece this history together bit by bit, sorting out and making sense out of all the
numerous (deliberate) inconsistencies while trying to figure out what part he or she has
yet to play in all of it.  Since unravelling this history is part of the experience I
won't say any more about it.

<br><br>

While the game's main quest is linear, the player is completely free to wander off on his
or her own.  The player can at any time join one or more of seven available factions
(three Houses and four Guilds), depending on the player's tastes, to perform various
quests and ultimately rise in rank, completely independent of and pretty much
inconsequential to the main storyline.  Naturally, the factions have rivalries so some
combinations of memberships are incompatible, e.g. one Fighters' Guild quest is to take
out the bosses of the Thieves' Guild.  
<br><br>

In addition to the main quest and various House or Guild quests, just roaming around the
countryside you will run into people needing assistance, whether it be retrieving stolen
possessions from nearby thieves, providing an escort through dangerous territory, making
deliveries to nearby towns, offering healing or curing, settling disputes between poachers
and natives, helping the town guard silence opposition parties, or even acting as a love
note courier between a smitten woman and the thief that robbed her (okay, that one was
weird).  There are tons of these "miscellaneous quests" scattered throughout the land.  
<br><br>

Finally, there are hundreds of ruins, abandoned forts, caves, tombs, mine shafts, and
other underground structures all over the island just waiting for freelance adventurers. 
The denizens and loot within are usually well-tailored to the player's level.  The only
problem I found with this type of freelancing is many of these caves and such contain
items or people related to faction quests, and killing these people off, or taking and
then selling the loot (and forgetting where you sold it), could potentially prevent you
from fulfilling those quests in the future.  I never actually ran into this problem
though.

Okay, I hate these Cliff Racers, honestly they serve no purpose other than be really
annoying.  They come down at you from high in the sky and start attacking you from behind.
 They're very easy to kill, so they're just a nuisance, like a mosquito.  I seriously
considered looking for a mod that would remove them from the game.

<b>Update 8/17:</b> I just finished the "Tribunal" expansion pack, which adds a whole new
city to explore, about 6-10 large quests, a fairly large number of miscellaneous quests,
several new building architectures, underground structures, voices, monsters, and a few
enhancements to the engine (e.g. quest-indexed journal, NPCs for hire, pack rats).  In
addition you finally get to meet Almalexia and Sotha Sil, the remaining two members of the
Tribunal not present in Morrowind proper.  You begin by investigating who has hired the
Dark Brotherhood to assassinate you, which quickly takes you to Almalexia's city,
Mournhold.  There you begin simultaneously working for her and the newly crowned King
Helseth, performing a number of intriguing quests in the vast tunnels under Mournhold.  My
one complaint would be that it's obvious fairly early on that Almalexia is somewhat mad,
and Helseth is just a conniving bastard, but to move the plot forward the game give you no
choice but to do their bidding.  Overall, however, it's more of the same great stuff for
Morrowind lovers and well worth the $20.

<b>Update 11/6:</b> After giving Morrowind a few months rest, I got my hands on Bloodmoon,
the latest expansion pack.  By now, it's in the bargain bin--just the way I like my games.
 Well, actually, this usually isn't so much a choice as it is a necessity given the fact
my gaming box is usually way behind the cutting edge.  Anyhow, for $15.95, you can hardly
beat the gaming value for the money :-).

<br><br>
 
Unlike Tribunal, it's more like the original Morrowind gameplay, since the new island is
just another part of the Vvardenfell landscape, there are dozens of little caves and
pockets and miscellaneous quests everywhere, all framed but unhindered by the Main Quest. 
Also like the original, it again comes with a wonderfully drawn, detailed map which gives
hints on locations where treasure and other interesting things may be found.  The Main
Quest is geared around werewolves, and in fact you may choose to become one, with all the
associated benefits (great strength) and limitations (inability to control when you
change, potential for game-wide ostracization if someone sees you change).  I read this
was quite a challenge for the developers to modify the game engine to handle this. 
However, at my level, the limitations outweighed the benefits since being a werewolf was
actually less powerful than my normal souped-up array of weapons, charms, spells, etc.  

<br><br>

More fun, well worth the money.  Okay, I'm ready for the next game from these guys.

Hmm morrowind is a great game as you said but you didnt really talk about
he dwemer or daedric ruins, which really are where you get the cream of
your equipment. cept dren plantation.
I am supprised you didnt talk about how you can actually come to help the
'inferior' daedric gods out.

oh and i have a Custom Item you might like for the future
Hanzo Sword (modded Daedric Katana)
same stats as daedric katana
cast on hit
Shock Damage 50
Fire Damage 50

Five months later and hundreds of dead in my wake I return. I absolutely
LOVE Trueflame, though you can make a weapon that does exactly as much
damage magic and otherwise, it just doesnt have that great, albeit lagging,
flame effect. Instead I have decided to Outfit every outfitter in the land
with Dwemer Armor, the Dwemer LIVE!<br />

Little Advice, if all the drarves just turned to dust as posed by the ashes
left behind, why didn't yagrum do the same?<br />

What wouldve been a great little thing? the ability to use those

Yes, I hear you about the annoying cliff racers.  I did eventually write a

It became somewhat comical, walking around, constantly hearing &quot;zap!

Morrowind is a great game, even though I was slightly disapointed by the
final battle with Dagoth Ur. I was expecting....a little more of a

There are instructions in the Tribunal box on how to open up the expansion
story line and get to Mournhold.  Basically, you have to sleep somewhere
for 24 hours, after which you will be ambushed by a Dark Brotherhood
assassin.  Then just talk to any guard for instructions on what to do next.
 Here is a good resource:

Bob, first you have to buy the Tribunal expansion pack. Just making
sure...<br />
<br />
If you have it, play the game regularly for a few days. Sooner of alter, an
assasin will try to kill you, and that's when the Tribunal quests start.
Just follow the instructions; ask the guard, find the guy in ebonheart,
etc. and e3ventually you will get a transport of mournhold.

Hi glenn, after running your post through babelfish :-), I realized you're
referring to how Sunder will cause self-damage every second--unless you're
wielding Wraithguard to protect you.  Google around for &quot;sunder
wraithguard&quot; and you'll see what I mean.  I'm pretty sure I didn't
find anything significantly better than Sunder through all the expansion
packs, so it's worth figuring out how to wield it.

Oblivion: first impressions: looks like fun, with a rich, detailed
story-line.  The graphics are amazing, but I find it disappointing that
maxed out they're still sluggish even on top of the line equipment.  The
quests seem good, with actual substance and worthwhile rewards.  But the
world seems awfully empty and artificial to me after a year of playing
World of Warcraft.  The NPCs have these ridiculous, pointless conversations
in the street.  While it's nice to not to have to see level 1 Night Elf
females dancing stripclub-style on top of the mailbox in the middle of
Ironforge, and it's nice to get away from the stupid pre-pubescent flames
in Barrens chat, and--above all--it's nice to have a working Pause key
again, it's something I've already put down and will probably not pick up
again until I'm finally sick of WoW.

No, I would agree. To me Oblivion is a lot more boring than Morrowind. For
me, one of the big things is that the story lines are all pretty weak, and
the new writers they have know *nothing* about the lore. Ah well, hopefully

I love mrrowind tribunal and bloodmoon. Dwemer sstuff is the best. Sunder
and Keening are good. they are best if you like original idea and lore
based weapons. the are more legendary and serverd 1 perpose, to create
anuduim the dwemer god. they last a short time when using on enemys. The
problem with being a high level charcteer is that you can only strike a
weapon once than u have to repair it. Otherwise best game ever played<br

i use many many mods too!! dwemer based y'no and the occasionsal houses
fortresses and text replavers

I have been playing Morrowind for 4 months now and it's the best open ended
visually pleasing game in its class.  I just started over cuz I wanted to
go from a Khajit Thief, to a new Mod elf race with black wings battlemage. 
Where do I get the horde ranch mod?

Yes i have a question, i hope you know the answer if you buy the GOTY
edition will you be able to keep you old morrowind file and load it to this
game? Cause if i could i wouldn't have to find all my items all over again
i have 100's of deadric weapons and all the Deadric god's weapons but i'm
sure you have them too so if you could get back to me i'd be happy
thanks.<br />

getting inside vivec's palace is part of the main quest, or you can use an

Hey all!<br />
I really wanna know what race and character all you are playing Morrowind
with. I am a grim, aloof, dark-minded Dunmer Ashlander who is gonna be the
nerevarine and &quot;will sweep all the n'wah from Morrowind&quot;!
Ashlanders hate foreigners... so does my ashlander. Really love the
portable ashlander tent mod!!<br />

btw the name of my ashlander is Sharannu Ashutashpi; im kinda proud of it.
nobody in the game has the same name as I do! (earlier, I played with
Redoran Dunmer &quot;Lloros Morethi&quot;, both first and last name already
existed in the game. However, he was awesome.)<br />

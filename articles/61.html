Over Labor Day weekend Angela and I went up to Berkeley to attend Angela's cousin's
wedding.  It was 10 years ago (in the fall semester of '93) that Angela and I met at UC
Berkeley as students in the Unit 3 dormitory, so while we were in the area we took a
little time after the big event to visit some of our favorite sites near the campus and
indulge in a bit of nostalgia.  
<br><br>

Here are some photos from our trip, starting with Telegraph Avenue, then finishing on
campus.  One thing to note is we were doing this at around 11am on Sunday, so although
school is in session, there aren't a lot of people out and about on the streets, and the
campus appeared to be pretty much deserted.  Too early in the semester for anyone to be
studying, I guess :-).

The high-rise in the center of the picture is one of the four buildings that make up Unit
3.  The building Angela and I lived in faces the pictured building.

Pictured here are the two major pizza joints in the area, which provided lots of slices of
delicious pizza well into the very late hours of the night for myself and countless other
students.  Blondie's is the older, and I believe the better, but Fat Slice is a serious
contender.

In the center of the picture here is Rasputin's Records, a great place to browse for music
and find music from many obscure groups you definitely wouldn't find at your typical
mainstream music shop.  Despite the rise in popularity of online music shopping (myself
included) there's something nice about flipping through CDs trying to find anything new by
your favorite groups--and odds are if it exists, this place has it.

Annapurna is one of the local curiosities in Berkeley, a head shop where you can purchase
all sorts of paraphernalia for smoking, ahem, tobacco.  All perfectly legal.

But remember kids: this is a Drug Free Zone, so you'll have to go somewhere else to find
drugs to smoke in the stash you just bought at Annapurna.  Right.  These signs definitely
weren't there 10 years ago.  It was too early in the morning to judge if the pushers were
really gone or not.

Here's what I felt to be a rather cinematic shot of Wheeler Hall, with the centerpiece of
the campus, the Campanile, rising in the background.  I always thought the Campanile was a
beautiful attraction, so much that I even requested a particular dorm room my sophomore
year where I could see it out my window.

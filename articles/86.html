Here are some photos and some commentary on my recent efforts to wire up my house with
ethernet, phone, and video in every room.  The whole point of this was to be able to move
my wireless access point downstairs (where I was hoping I'd get a better signal), to
provide phone for our current Tivo series 1, and to provide network for my Xbox, a
possible future Tivo 2, and whatever future home media appliance I might install.

<br><br>

As these things always go, it was a LOT more work than I thought it would be--in fact, I
expected it to be more work than I thought it would be, and it was even more work than
that! :-).  Really the hard parts came down to the physical labor--it's easy to visualize
what I wanted, but actually implementing it is another story.  I'm not even sure how much
money this cost me, or how much time it took.  I had to buy a lot of supplies, and they
were more expensive than I anticipated, and of course there are the one-time expenses of
all those tools you need but don't already have.  As far as time, I spent several weekends
and nights after work getting all this done.

<br><br>

To make things easier, I broke the project into several phases:

<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Identify desired locations of wall jacks and cabling routes.
<li>Phase 2: Purchase required tools, equipment, and supplies.
<li>Phase 3: Cut/drill holes.
<li>Phase 4: Run cabling, manage cabling.
<li>Phase 5: Wire up and install wall jacks.
<li>Phase 6: Mount wall bracket, wire up patch panel, mount switch and shelf.
<li>Phase 7: Run phone and video into attic and splice in.
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>Phase 1: Identify desired locations of wall jacks and cabling routes. </h4>

The first task was fairly easy, given I already knew where I wanted what, and that was
driving this whole project.  I wanted to install network and phone behind the
entertainment center in the family room (there was already video), and I wanted to install
all three behind the piano in the living room.  What finally occurred to me after a while
of agonizing over the near-impossibility of drilling down two stories from the attic, was
that both these locations share a wall with the garage, and that the closet in the office
upstairs (where I wanted to run everything) is right above the garage.  So I realized,
forget the attic--I'll run everything through the garage and just try to make it as neat
as I can.

<br><br>

Wiring the master and both bedrooms upstairs will have to wait for another time (soon,
hopefully).  For these I will want to drill down from the attic.

<hr>
<h4>Phase 2: Purchase required tools, equipment, and supplies.</h4>

I had most of the basic household tools, hammer, screwdrivers, electric drill, etc, but I
needed to obtain some more hardware supplies:

<ul>
<li>Drywall saw
<li>Drill bits of various sizes (1/2", 3/4", and 1")
<li>12" drill extension.
<li>Junction boxes
</ul>

In the networking department, I needed:

<ul>
<li>Lots of Cat6 cabling, at least 300-400 feet.
<li>Plenty o' modular wall jacks.
<li>Several 4 port wall plates.
<li>A 19" wide, 12" deep, 4U wall-mounted bracket.
<li>A 12 port patch panel.
<li>A rack-mountable, 12-16 port switch.
<li>A shelf.
<li>Plenty of zip ties.
<li>Lots of adhesive cabling mounts.
<li>Wire stripper.
<li>Punch tool.
<li>Electrical tape.
</ul>

I took this picture early on, so some things I used are not pictured (like the 12" deep
wall bracket--I returned the 4" deep one pictured, and I returned the electric blue
ethernet cable and bought white):

<br><br>

A bunch of this stuff I bought at Fry's because it was a Saturday when I wanted to get
started, and none of my favorite shops were open (Beach Wire and Cable, Graybar).  This
ended up being a mistake, not just because Fry's is such a nightmare, but also because I
ended settling on a couple items (wall bracket, cabling) and paying more than I could have
off Amazon (Dlink switch).  Fortunately, and I'll give Fry's credit, they took these items
back with no questions.  Afterwards I bought everything I needed from Beach Wire, where I
got exactly what I wanted.

Here's the first location in the family room, behind the entertainment center.  If I'd
been more on the ball I would have done this before we had the unit installed, but that's
how things go.  Since there's only 3-4" of open space behind it, I really had no choice
but to put the wall plate right in the middle.  I figured the TV will cover it so that's
okay.

I just made the first cut, and it's at this point--when you begin destroying your
home--that you really hope you know what you're doing :-).  This was a difficult cut to
make since I was shooting blind, hoping I would have a clear path to the garage wall, some
3-4 feet away, passing through an open space within the walls of the house.

Aww, @%$#!  What's this behind the wall?!  Turns out I ran right into a large wall of
concrete.  I need to be more to the left, but there's a large stud blocking my path.  I'll
need to make another cut more to the left.  Too bad, since I really wanted the jack to be
more to the right, so it would be less visible in the room.

The whole idea is to run cabling from the family and living rooms through the garage up
through that hole.  You can see the water heater to the right (with the wooden stick
coming from the family room).  The run from the living room (behind us) will pass
overhead.

There was one more hole to make in the office closet, and that is through the ceiling to
run phone and video cabling up into the attic, where they can splice into the cabling that
I know exists up there.  That'll be my last phase though.

on the right, with a little bit of paint and sanding you'd never know :-).

So at this point, I'd been working on this project for a while, and really wanted to get
some payoff.  So I crimped one of the cables upstairs, plugged it into my switch, and did
a few tests with my laptop.

So finally, and triumphantly, I moved my Airport Extreme wireless access point downstairs,
and began enjoying better signal strength (actually, this didn't end up being the panacea
I'd hoped for, and leads to a different story which I'll post later).

At this point I took a break for this project a while, since at the moment I had working
access downstairs, never mind the waterfall of cable in the closet.  However I was already
making plans to put my own personal, wall-mounted rack above the closet shelf.

Here I've centered and mounted my rack mount U bracket.  Just behind it you can see a
slightly larger piece of pressboard I obtained from the good people at Lowe's, who cut for
me a custom-sized piece from some 1/2 inch scrap they had lying around.  I painted it,
then attached it to a stud in the wall with 4 wood screws, then attached the bracket to
it, which will make everything quite sturdy.

I've finished punching down the cabling, and now I've attached the switch and a 10" deep
shelf.  Unfortunately the genii at Dlink spaced their holes incorrectly so I had to fudge
it a bit.  The shelf will hold my cable modem and NAT router.

Here's the finished product.  A neat and organized network hub for my house.  I need to
clean up those nasty cables on the right, and probably get shorter patch cables than those
blue ones (6" ones would probably do), but I'm working on it :-).

systems in that room, and the cables on the left will be going up into the attic in the
next phase.

<h4>Phase 7: Run phone and video into attic and splice in.</h4>

I don't have any pictures from this phase, all I did was run those loose cables on the
left in the last picture up through the hole in the ceiling of the office closet into the
attic.  Up there, I spliced each into the phone and TV cable that was conveniently running
just above.  One thing I must point out to anyone thinking of working in their attic:
<b>be sure to wear a protective filtration mask</b>.  I spent about 5-10 minutes up there,
crawling around, stirring up fiberglass dust from the insulation, before I could stand it
no longer.  I came down, blew my nose and all this black stuff came out :-).  So I went to
Lowe's and bought a mask, and was able to spend the required 20-30 minutes up there with
no problems.

<h4>Summary</h4>

It's been a lot of work, but I finally have network, phone, and video everywhere
downstairs like I've been wanting for a while.  Still to do is wiring the master bedroom,
to accommodate the Tivo we have in there.  This will require drilling down the walls from
the attic, and already I know from my time up there it's going to be cramped and
difficult.  To be continued.

Good job Steve, it looks great! I especially like the mini wall-mount
rack/cabinet thingy you used. Very clean, very professional. Houses should
be built like this!

Thanks Erik!  I also think the wall mounted rack was the highlight of the
project.  If I had to do it again I'd probably get a taller one to
accommodate more shelves, wire management, etc--but then again 4u is nice
and compact.  I agree, all houses should come prewired like this. 
Unfortunately for me, while we bought our house new five years ago, it
already had all the drywall up before we ever saw it, so there was no way
to add network cabling then.  I've heard that many modern tracks are doing
this though (e.g. Ladera Ranch)--lucky them.

Steve:

I enjoyed reading all about your project here and the details that you
included (e.g., the part where you encountered the concrete!). I learned
about a new place to get network hardware (i.e., Beach Wire & Cable). How
much did you spend on the cable? Where did you get your Cat 6 Patch Panel?
What was the frustration you encountered with the AirPort?

I bought an AirPort Express the other week. I had originally thought about
purchasing it for a number of cool features (e.g., range extension,
streaming music to our Bose stereo, and possibly connecting a photo
printer). However, I guess I didn't read enough of the details. You MUST
HAVE an existing 802.11g network to extend the range of your existing
network. All the other features are backward compatible. Nice little box,
too.

OS X 10.3.5 is a little slow on The Cube, but thinking that I might invest
in a faster (and larger) HDD and some additional 133 SDRAM. I purchases two
external LaCie HDD: one for audio (13K+ songs) and one for visual (iMovie
and iPhoto). I'm scanning all of our family photographs and distributing
them to verious family members.

In iTunes, there is an additional field called "Grouping." I use this field
as a sub-genre (e.g., go to http://www.allmusic.com/ and see the field
called "Styles." This way, I can narrow playlists down a little further
(e.g., Classic Rock, Trip-Hop, Neo Traditionalist, etc.) It's something
even the folks at Ubernet.org can't do. Hurray Apple! *smile*

Hey Kindig!  Glad you enjoyed the post.  It really was an adventure (and a
lot of work!) getting the downstairs wired up, but it's been extremely
worthwhile.  I no longer have any problems with wireless reception since
being able to place two base stations downstairs.  

The frustration I encountered with my Airport was when I found that moving
it downstairs improved, but did not completely remedy my interference
problems.  I then went out and bought a cheapy Linksys WAP54G and was a bit
chagrined to find it had a consistently better signal than the Airport, at
less than half the cost!  Of course, it's not nearly as stylish as the
Airport :-), which actually fits in my living room as a piece of furniture;
in the family room I've hidden the ugly Linksys behind the TV set.  Now
with two stations downstairs, the signal is excellent throughout the
house.

Beach Wire is a great place, the guys there are friendly and can help you
pick out stuff you need over the phone.  Only downside is the place doesn't
have an on-line catalog.  I think I paid about $120 for 1000 feet of high
quality Cat6.  The Cat6 patch panel I picked up at Fry's, though you could
certainly get it at BW.

The Airport Express looks pretty cool.... very handy little base station. 
I think I also read that (without some hacking) it can only extend the
range of other Airport base stations.  I love Apple's i-apps too, glad to
hear from a fellow Apple user enjoying his Mac!

I got something very similar to this in my house.. but a little more
advanced, because I live in a pretty large house lol.. cost a fortune
though, and took about a week or two.. I don't exactly remember since it's
been a while.<br />

One year of Macintosh and Mac OS X
</div>

<div id="articleSubtitle">
Sat Apr 19th 2003, 4:57pm

</div> <!-- articleSubtitle -->
<div id="articleBody">
Just a little over a year ago I did something impulsive, shedding years of unfounded
prejudice against an entire computer genre: I bought a Power Macintosh G4.  Now while it
was impulsive, I'd been hearing from <a href="http://www.willfife.com">Will</a> (to whom I
owe thanks) for a while bits and pieces about the new face of Macintosh, and Apple's new
sophisticated operating system that supposedly combined the best of proprietary operating
systems with open source.  It's hard even to remember my exact state of mind when I did
this, though I remember the reason finally pushing me over the edge was a posting on
Slashdot comparing the rendering abilities (esp. regarding fonts) of various browsers on
multiple platforms.  Of course, at the time, the various Linux/BSD browsers sucked (Opera
and Konquerer were probably the best, with at least some degree of anti-aliased fonts
through QT), and IE under Windows was second only to... IE on the Mac.  

<br><br>

The screenshots didn't lie.  The Mac was clearly king.  

<br><br>

Now as a DOS user growing up, then a Linux user in college (I call this conversion
"enlightenment"), then a FreeBSD user, then mostly back to Linux and Solaris after working
in the industry a while, Macs had never been on my scope--at all.  In fact, in the typical
way one fears that which one does not know, I'd even been somewhat anti-Mac all this time,
though I couldn't really tell you why.  But after 9 years of using Linux, Free/Net/OpenBSD
with X Windows, TWM, E, Gnome, KDE, even WindowMaker for a brief stint, and whatever else,
even I, one who normally doesn't go out of his way to look for change, saw this new,
interesting, and powerful and <i>beautiful</i> technology and decided it could in fact be
something very interesting.

<br><br>

It has, in fact turned out to be very cool, interesting, and refreshing.  There's a lot of
stuff going on in Mac OS X.  But basically here are the highlights, from someone used to
Linux and BSD:

<ul>
<li> Web browsing is absolutely gorgeous, it's the best looking web surfing experience
you've ever had.  Other than the occasional annoyance of a site that doesn't work right
(see negatives), everything looks absolutely spectacular.  I never realized how much I'd
appreciate this until I had it.
<li> Multimedia works out of the box.  Videos (Windows media, Quicktimes, etc) on websites
just work.  No more messing around with Xine or CodeWeavers plugins to get basic videos to
work.  My digital camera just plugged in and worked, and with iPhoto I actually now have a
decent photo library.
<li> The userland utilities (ls, find, chmod, etc) and networking stack were basically
ripped verbatim from FreeBSD.  This was very comforting since it is already very
familiar.
<li> So many packaged applications that all work beautifully together, iPhoto, Mail,
Safari, make sending scaled photos to friends a two click job, make burning a DVD as
simple as drag and drop, etc, etc.
<li> Anything you used on Linux is probably ported to OS X, and X11 apps work great with
Apple's X11 display server (e.g. Gimp, Evolution, Emacs).  The only problem with this is I
tend to dislike running most Linux apps since they look so terrible compared to everything
else on my desktop :-).
</ul>

And now, the downsides:

<ul>
<li> I still have trouble getting used to the fact that Home and End take you to the
beginning and end of a document, not the line.  Between working on a Mac at home, and
Linux and Solaris machines at work I often find myself hitting the wrong keys for the
first few minutes of every session.
<li> Occassionally web sites do not render correctly, in either IE or Safari.
<li> Being used to "focus follows mouse", and available keybindings for raising/lowering
windows, having to use the mouse more often than I'd like is still a bit of a minor
annoyance.
<li> For as rock-solid a core OS as OS X should have, I still feel like I end up rebooting
the machine more often than I'd like due to lockups or software upgrades.  For example, to
upgrade Quicktime 6.1 to 6.1.1 requires a reboot.
<li> Because of the zillions of zany effects going on, the machine seems slow at times
(933MHz G4). 
<li> And I can't make a downside list without mentioning the price.  Yowzers.  Did I
mention it's the best web surfing experience ever? :-)
</ul>

There's so much more to say, this barely scratches the surface.  In summary: the Mac is
cool, it's fun, powerful, advanced, and beautiful, and I'm glad I got it.  But have I "<a
href="http://www.apple.com/switch/">switched</a>", per se?  Considering I use Linux and
Solaris at work, and FreeBSD, Linux and sometimes my Windows PC here at home, I'd say not
completely, since each platform still has certain unique strengths that outweigh the
others.  Use the right tool for the job.

Well, I for one have been VERY happy with my mac decision.  Currently I'm
in the process of moving computers, data, operating systems and such around
in the house, so that I will have a decent video server, a windows PC, and
my mac both working off of a KVM, and a system for video conferencing in
the living room.  Over all, I basically just need to get off my ass and
take care of everything.

Will, your powerbook is pretty sweet, I've been a bit jealous of it ever
since you got it... :-)  Maybe some day I'll get the 12" pb, when they've

Hee hee. I bought my first Mac awhile ago -- the mac Cube. Since then, I
bought an iBook for Regina and a PowerBook G4 for me. I like OSX, even
though I probably don't utilize the full Unix potential. "Hybriding" a
network has been easy. I have an Apple Airport (bridge) and a Linksys
router (firewall). I'm not happy with the WiFi range. I'm getting around to
building one of those "Pringle's can" antennas.

Steve -- get your amateur radio license! Erik, Chris, and I have one. Then,
you can do APRS! :)

Michael, though of course I wasn't into Macs at the time, looking back I
like the looks of the cube.  Fanless, right?  I think they're pretty neat
looking, nice and compact.  I wonder why they didn't take off more than
they did.  
<br><br>

You know I have thought about getting the amateur radio license, I think
the APRS stuff you guys are doing is really cool.

Well, well, well...All the bad mouthing rants about an obsolete system
waiting to die during those harsh months at NI are starting to come back
and bite all of you in the kernel!!  Hee!! Hee!!!  Sorry, just had to
harass you about that.
The G4 wasn't the machine to use for performance testing. The 17" iMac 1Ghz
would be the minimum machine to use for OS X. I'm loving what I have now,
though I understand the new G5 flat panel machines are SWEEEEEET!  Glad to
hear the dark side is shedding some light!!!!!

Yeah, Jim, I totally eat my words from back at NI :-).  I wrote this
article a year and a half ago, and since then have grown to like them even
more.  I've been very happy with each new release of OS X, and find the
i-apps quite suitable for all my digital needs.   We have three Macs now in
our house, the PowerMac mentioned in this article, and a laptop each for my
wife and me.   They're great!

Hi Steve, let me just say that I've been reading your articles since the
first one came up, I bet you didn't know you have an avid reader of this
page wich uses &quot;english as a second language :)&quot; anyway, just
wanted to ask you if you are still using the Mac and/or an update on this
article, I bought a Mac Mini (1.42/512) two months ago and all I can say is
wow!. what a piece of work, and the python bindings (my soup) on 10.3.9
(somehow I've been reluctant to go to 10.4 mostly due to the horror stories
in the apple forums) keep me using it probably as much as I use my Linux
box (centos), anyway is always nice to have an opportunity to wish you the
best. blessed be.

Hey Julio!  It's great to hear from you, I'm glad you posted something to
let me know you're reading!  Yeah, since I got that first Mac I've added
two more to the house: a Powerbook for myself, and an iBook for my
wife--and we both love them.  Also, just on Monday I started using a Mac at
work (a Mac Mini like yours) and let me say it's awesome to finally get to
use a Mac at work after years of using Linux.  I really don't consider
myself a Mac fanatic--I certainly have a few complaints about them--but
overall they're so pleasant and easy to use I'm finding it increasingly
difficult to understand why not everyone uses them :-).  Anyways, thanks
and best wishes to you too.  Hopefully I'll be adding some more content
soon...

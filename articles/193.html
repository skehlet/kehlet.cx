I am thrilled to see Diedrich coffee returning to Tustin under a new brand, Kean Coffee. 
The Tustin location has quite a history for me, and from several other people I recognized
and/or talked to on Saturday, quite a history for many others as well.

<br />
<br />

At age 15 I was introduced to good coffee at the Tustin Diedrich's, and it soon grew to be
my regular stomping grounds with friends in high school.  I imagine the older clientele
didn't appreciate our loud teenage behavior (I will never forget an incident of slipping
on wet floor near the bathroom, falling on my back side, and swearing loudly like only a
teenager could in front of at least a dozen other customers), but the coffee was
excellent, and the atmosphere upscale but relaxed, so we all managed to get along.  I have
so many memories of sitting and talking to friends there over coffee through college.

<br />
<br />

That was all quite a while ago.  Fast forward to 2006, and one day I walked into my
regular Trabuco Hills Diedrich's and read a little sign on the counter that said <a
href="http://www.kehlet.cx/articles/145.html">Diedrich's was closing its stores and
selling them all to Starbucks</a>.  The horror!  A little piece of myself was getting
bulldozed by the evil juggernaut.  Indeed, some time later I recall driving by my old
Diedrich's and seeing a cookie cutter Starbucks in its place.  I didn't stop.

<br />
<br />

A little while after that, I learned that Martin Diedrich had actually left his namesake
business some time ago, and had started up <a
href="http://www.kehlet.cx/articles/146.html">Kean Coffee in Newport Beach</a>.  That's
K&eacute;an, "Kee'-uhn", named after his son.  I visited and actually met the man behind
my coffee addiction.  Great coffee.

<br />
<br />

Two years later, Starbucks, facing a serious glut of stores in a declining economy, closed
the Tustin location.  And an opportunity was born.

<br />
<br />

In March 2009 Kean Coffee opened up its second store at that very same location in Tustin.
 And on Saturday and Sunday this weekend Angela and I visited it and had coffee.  The
choice in locations was obviously no coincidence.  Angela recognized one of the baristas
behind the counter, the same guy that used to make her drinks way back when.  I asked one
of the other baristas how long the shop had been open--he wasn't quite sure (a few days
maybe?), it was his second day, but for him too it was a bit of a homecoming.  He and I
exchanged a few stories of how we'd been fans of the old Diedrich's, and the trademark
roaster on the premises.  He was clearly a coffee lover and a much bigger connoisseur than
I am.  He described his experience so far of working there with the people who select and
roast the coffee there every day, and he described a difference between Starbucks and
Kean's was that at Kean's, coffee making is a culinary art.  I could sense the awe in his
voice.  He said several of the people there had all worked at Diedrich's in the past (some
at that very store).  I could only imagine what they had done or given up to come back to
where they used to work.  On the way out, the roaster was spinning away under careful
oversight.

<br />
<br />

I am glad my Diedrich's is back, even better than I remember it.

This is too cool!  This Diedrich's was my first introduction to an actual
coffee house (we didn't have anything like it in St. Louis at the time).  I
can honestly say that my current coffee addiction can be traced back to
this very store.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to a return visit some day.<br />

Morrowind Modding
</div>

<div id="articleSubtitle">
Sat Feb 7th 2004, 3:02pm

</div> <!-- articleSubtitle -->
<div id="articleBody">
Morrowind has continued to be quite entertaining and demonstrated a surprising replay
value.  However shortly after I started a new game a short while ago I got interested in
the game engine itself and its modding potential.  Included with the game is a
construction kit, which supposedly is everything the folks at Bethesda had when crafting
exteriors, interiors, NPCs, monsters, quests, dialog, scripting, etc.  What's interesting
about this kit is that you have the ability to build your exteriors and interiors by
dragging-and-dropping components, snapping the pieces together like legos, and viewing
your progress in a live 3D rendering.  The kit comes with hundreds of 3D objects and
textures (the same as those used in the game) which you simply move, rotate, and piece
together to form whatever buildings/structures/landscapes you can imagine.  

<br><br>

I don't know, maybe all the games are coming out with mod kits this cool these days, I
haven't tried to build levels for Dungeon Siege or Neverwinter Nights, but this is
<i>frickin' cool</i>, and a giant leap over the crappy, hall-of-mirror-prone,
draw-it-line-by-line, bound-to-look-like-crap-no-matter-what-you-do stuff I used to do
when building levels for Doom.  Yeah, I guess it's been a while :-).

<br><br>

<a href="/~kehlet/images/2004/01/full/tesck.jpg"><img
src="/~kehlet/images/2004/01/tesck.jpg" align="right"></a>

It's not too hard to get started, while the construction kit isn't the greatest, most
intuitive Windows app ever, the controls become easier to use with practice.  The biggest
hurdle is getting accustomed to the way in which you manipulate 3D objects with a 2D
visual and mouse--you end up using key combinations like holding down 'z' to indicate you
want the mouse gestures to translate to movement in the z-axis direction instead of x or
y.  There are plenty of components to build pretty complicated interiors and exteriors,
although sometimes you find yourself wishing there was another component that had a higher
ceiling, with stairs, with textured walls instead of plain, etc.  I can envision the level
designers at Bethesda shouting to each other in the halls, "hey Joe, make me another
ex_com_corner_rich2a component, but with <i>green</i> walls instead of brown".  You can
certainly create and import these textures yourself if you have the appropriate 3D object
creation and rendering software.

<br><br>

The scripting engine built into the game is perhaps the most exciting part, allowing the
level designer to control objects and NPCs in the game, add intelligence to quests,
perform actions dynamically based on certain criteria, etc, etc.  The language reminds me
of AppleScript (e.g. begin/end blocks, <code>set foo to 1</code>).  The study of what you
can do is so in-depth it has spawned various "Dummy's Guides" and "Scripting Bibles"
available on the net.  However it can be a bit frustrating when you have something in your
mind that you want to do but eventually realize it is simply not possible given the
limited function set.  Also, you quickly realize while writing scripts that they tend to
be error-prone and often do not do what you intend, due to the enormous complexities
involved in the way the game works and objects interact.  So as cool as the scripting
engine is--and it truly is--I think it speaks a lot to its realistic potential when you
realize most of the scripts Bethesda shipped with Morrowind were extremely simple--because
anything more complicated didn't work well and couldn't make it past QA.

<br><br>

After a few practice mods, I decided to make a house for the player, as many first-time
modders do.  It's a natural choice because it's easy, quite practical (i.e. somewhere to
store your extra junk), and for some reason the game never gives you one (not until the
Bloodmoon expansion, that is) [correction 4/04: you can get a house by pursuing one of the
House faction quests].  Groping for a name I picked "Hero's Hovel", liking the
alliteration, and chuckling to myself over its cheesiness.  The screenshots to the right
show the exterior I created, using components from the "Nordic" theme (grey stone).  I
picked a mountainside area outside Pelegiad (a quiet, civilized area in the Southwest)
which was otherwise unoccupied.  You can see the extensive wooden platforms and stairs I
added to give access from the area below.  Inside I created a three-story structure, with
a living area, an NPC to act as your personal assistant, a cellar, and a series of one-way
magic portals to various key locations around the land (a la the Matrix).  Fun, and
practical.

<br><br>

I decided to post my mod to the <a href="http://rpgplanet.com/morrowind/">Morrowind
Summit</a>, just for fun.  I later found out about 450 other people have posted house mods
(d'oh!), but despite the competition mine's managed to rack up over 1500 downloads so far,
three "excellent" ratings, and quite a few positive responses via the site's comment
system and direct emails.  Unfortunately the one thing marring this otherwise enjoyable
experience was the negative feedback and several rounds of emails from one certain user
who, in retrospect, has managed to make something of a name for himself on the site by
doing nothing more than trashing every uploaded mod, including mine.  Internet users
beware: Napoleon is alive and well, age 14, and posting on a forum near you.

<br><br>

You can find my mod <a
href="http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&id=1998 ">here</a>
(hosted on gamespy, to download you'll need a fileplanet login) or <a
href="http://www.kehlet.cx/docs/heros_hovel.zip">here</a> (direct).  It's been fun, but
surprisingly time consuming.

<br><br>

Final note: the construction kit is impressive but it's still easy to foresee even better
tools for level designers, automating more of your tasks, further distancing you from the
nitty gritty details, sanity checking more of your work, etc.  The scripting engine is
impressive but still could be so much cooler if it were more powerful.  For both playing
and modding purposes, I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment.

Sorry, it's been a year and a half since I did any Morrowind modding, so I
can't help you :-(.  I would definitely check out the Morrowind Summit at
http://www.rpgplanet.com/morrowind/index.asp to find manuals and tutorials
on modding and conversations.  I know there's more than enough info and
examples out there.  Good luck!

Thanks Eddie.  It's amazing to me people are still playing and modding
Morrowind, with Oblivion out and Morrowind being quite old by now, but I
guess that speaks to just what a great game it was.  Thanks for the link,
that looks like a great resource.<br />

an awesome mod (and the rost of the compliments you can think out) now for
the important part, i have an idea of what i want to do with the
construction set but can't figure out how to do it, i'm new to modding and
morrowind has, as mentioned great potential, even i can see that.<br />
<br />
My question is; if i where to give you some drawings of my idea, along with
stats for weapons, NPCs and stuff, would you do a comeback in modding
morrowind, if you think it's a good idea i have...<br />

Should you accept this idea, please email me at tobbe_the_beast@hotmail.com

Thanks TheGreatCthulhu for your interest in my site and for your post,
however I'm way too involved in World of Warcraft to come back to
Morrowind.  Good luck though!<br />

The Construction set can also make the game ALOT easier. A katana that does
255 damage, 6,000,000 fire damage with infinate charge, and 1,000,000
charge? thatsjust unfair.... also slight awsome. To be able to 1-shot
[spoiler block]? yes, yes you can.<br />

Thanks for the interest!  I see, to download the mod you need a fileplanet
login now, how annoying.  I added another link to a download directly off
my site.  Search for the text &quot;You can find my mod&quot; above.

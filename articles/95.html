<div id="articleBody">
Probably like a million other people out there, I got Doom 3, played it for a few days,
and decided that I really <i>did</i> need to upgrade my Windows box.  Sure, it played
reasonably at 640x480 on my Athlon XP 2000+/Radeon 9600 combo, but it'd been about 2 years
since I'd upgraded, and all my games were starting to suffer.  Plus there are more things
to look forward to on the PC in the near term (Half Life 2, etc).  

<br><br>

At work we've been buying a lot of Opteron systems for our compute farm, so I've come to
really like AMD's AMD64 and Hypertransport technologies.  So I figured I'd go for a junior
version of what I use at work and get an Athlon 64.  The sweet spot at the moment for the
gamer on a budget is the Athlon 64 3000, at ~ $150, only $10 more than the 2800, but $40
less than the 3200.  For a motherboard, I'd read a really <a
href="http://www.explosivelabs.com/reviews/s754roundup/pg6.shtml">great review</a> of the
AOpen AK86-L, an excellent price-performer at ~ $90.  Video card could use upgrading but
that can wait.  Throw in a half gig of DDR400/PC3200 memory on there and I should be all
set, brand new <i>fast</i> computer for ~ $350.

<br><br>

Then begins the nightmare.  Now I consider myself a pretty savvy consumer, especially for
on-line purchases--one not likely to fall prey to scams, and with a good sense of where
and where not to buy from.  Unfortunately, I let myself fall prey to a really shoddy
outfit that shipped me bad parts and took forever to do it.  

<br><br>

<b>Word of advice: do not buy from www.SMKSuperStore.com!</b>  I found them through <a
href="http://pricewatch.com/">Pricewatch</a>, as one of the cheaper sellers of the CPU I
wanted.  Also, I noticed they were located in Rancho Santa Margarita, just down the street
from me in fact, so I felt I was helping support a local business, and surely they should
be able to turn this around next day.  

<br><br>

I should have listened to my gut instinct, which was sending me warning signals while
browsing their site, only to be overruled by my senses of reason and logic which saw
nothing wrong on the surface.  If you take a look at their site, you'll see it looks like
a fairly typical small shop, which could be good--low overhead == good prices, right?  But
select a CPU--you'll see that they immediately start trying to upsell you other stuff you
don't need nor want, like thermal compound (the fan already has it), pre-testing the
equipment (why should this be necessary, stuff is supposed to work), and "expedited
service" (totally bogus fee, why I should I have to pay extra for better customer
service?).

<br><br>

I saw all this and ignored the subtle warning signs, and proceeded to buy my CPU and
memory from them. Not knowing that I wouldn't need it, I bought the cheap thermal
compound.  But I wouldn't pay for pre-testing or "expedited service".  Big mistake as it
turned out--on all 3 counts: I shouldn't have bought the thermal compound, and I should
have paid for the pre-testing and expedited service.  This was Sunday the 15th.

<br><br>

<a href="/images/2004/08/full/DSC00980.jpg"><img src="/images/2004/08/DSC00980.jpg"
align="left"></a>

I ordered the motherboard from Newegg.com, which turned it around next day, and I got it
on Tuesday.  Fabulous prices, free FedEx shipping (with whom I have a
no-signature-required waver on file), and fast.  5 stars to Newegg.  

<br clear="all"><br>

<a href="/images/2004/08/full/DSC00979.jpg"><img src="/images/2004/08/DSC00979.jpg"
align="right"></a>

And then I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  SMK didn't even process my order until
Thursday.  I guess they saw I was too cheap to pay for "expedited service" and decided to
punish me by sitting on it.  Fortunately, the $8 I paid for shipping (which only got me US
Priority mail) got me the package on Friday, not a huge surprise given the store, the post
office, and my house are all within a mile of each other.  Oops, but the USPS requires a
signature, and no one was home... (wah wah wah wah).  Finally I was able to pick it up on
Saturday the 21st at the local post office.  

<br><br>

<a href="/images/2004/08/full/DSC00986.jpg"><img src="/images/2004/08/DSC00986.jpg"
align="left"></a>

And then it was time to assemble everything.  I must say, I <i>really</i> like this
motherboard.  Great features, good layout, good docs, all kinds of tweaking/tuning
potential.  Got everything hooked up, turned it on--the moment of truth--and... 

<br><br>

BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  No video, nothing, just a bunch of beeps.  I could tell it was stuck
in a reboot cycle.  The motherboard support forums said this kind of beeping indicated a
memory problem.  Yanked everything but the power, CPU, and memory.  Same results.  Cleared
the CMOS, per the recommendation (same).  Removed the memory (same).  Removed the
CPU--nothing :-).  Not being a man of unlimited financial means, these kinds of problems
are hard to diagnose since I don't have stacks of spare parts lying around.  I finally
went to PC Club and picked up a memory stick to use as a test--same thing.  Okay... so
it's either the CPU or the motherboard.  Well I figured it was more likely the
motherboard, and in either case I'd get replacement parts faster from Newegg than SMK, so
I RMA'd it back to Newegg on Monday the 23rd.  Newegg turned it around and I received the
replacement on Friday the 27th.  Again, kudos to Newegg for fast service.  Hooked it up,
and...

<br><br>

<a href="/images/2004/08/full/DSC00985.jpg"><img src="/images/2004/08/DSC00985.jpg"
align="right"></a>

(you guessed it)  BEEP!  BEEP! ...   Argh, okay, it must be the CPU.  Went to PC Club,
picked up a CPU, popped it in... and voila, now it all works perfectly.  That was Saturday
the 28th :-).  Two weeks from payment to a working computer.

<br><br>

So now I'm stuck with a bad CPU, and memory stick, and a fan I don't want.  Let's hope I
can get my money back from my friends at SMK.  Maybe if I stick a $5 bill in the box
they'll expedite my refund.

<br><br>

<i>Epilogue:</i> I'm still a fan of on-line shopping, but I must say when stuff has to be
returned, nothing beats a brick and mortal shop.  In hindsight, I should have bought the
CPU and memory at <a href="http://www.pcclub.com/">PC Club</a>, whose prices are
comparable, or used the will call service at the local Lake Forest-based <a
href="http://www.allstarshop.com/">AllStarShop.com</a> (which I didn't <strike>know
about</strike> realize was a comparable deal [updated 9/5] until last week).  In any case,
this is just another horror story to remember before buying anything from another
rinky-dink on-line shop--trust your gut instincts.

<hr>

<b>Update 9/26/2004:</b> I did finally get refunded, not without some hassle--whatever,
enough said on that topic.  

<br><br>

Lovin' the new computer though.  Sure, Doom 3 is fun, but even it gets a bit old. 
Graphics are great but I think I'd forgotten just how boring first person shooters can
get: run, shoot.  Shoot, run.  Spin around, shoot.  What's really been a treat is playing
older games, like Morrowind, Black and White, and GTA.  As always, new hardware breaths
new life into older games.  Definitely need a new video card though.

AllStarShop and NewEgg are both great computer stores, and Ive had several
great experiences with both of them.  I also recommend using American
Express for all online purchases because they have the best consumer
protection.

Will:  thanks for the tip, I'll have to check out getting an AmEx card for
future online orders.  I'm still waiting for word on my refund from SMK
:-(.<br />
<br />
Matt: okay, I confess.  You did tell me about AllStarShop a while back but
at the time I thought the prices seemed a lot higher.  It wasn't until
after I'd placed my order elsewhere that I realized I was on crack.  For
example, the significantly higher price for a CPU was because--d'oh--it
comes with a fan.  Yeah, I got burned, and probably the reason why I got
irate enough to post about it was because I realized it was my own fault. 
Buyer beware.

I have one more constructive thing to add on this topic: I found what looks
to be a great online store accountability database at
http://resellerratings.com/.  Sure enough, Smksuperstore has a 4.0 of 10
lifetime rating, averaged over five categories.  If you remove
&quot;pricing of products&quot; from the average, they score 2.5 :-). 
Newegg on the other hand has a 9.71 average rating, with even, high scores
in all categories.  I took a few minutes to add both my positive and
negative feedback into their database.  They appear to take reasonable
measures to validate their submissions, and they reportedly have in excess
of 132,000.  I won't make a purchase again from a store I don't know
without first checking this database.  Yay accountability.

Do not trust merchant! I purchased an Intel Motherboard, P4 3.0 Ghz, 512 MB
RAM combo just the other day from this terrible company and my experience
was horrible. They took the funds straight from my credit card and I
received an order verification email. 2 Days later they sent another email
stating that my order was successfully processed and that I should expect
my items within 4 days. The following day they sent another email
cancelling my order!!! I called and they said that they ran out of all 3
parts, yet they were still selling them on their website. This seemed fishy
so I had a friend call to try and order the exact same parts that they said
that they no longer had. They told him that they had them in stock just
waiting to be purchased and they could ship them right out to him! I called
back and confronted them as I had caught them in their own lie. They
admitted that they had the items but no longer wanted to sell them to me
for the advertised price. They were rude and did nothing but lie and argue!
I filed a BBB complaint and also notified Pricewatch! They even have the
nerve to ask people to leave positive feedback before the merchandise is
even received. Still waiting for my credit card to be credited back more
than a week later. Steer cler of these people as they will rip you off!!!!
